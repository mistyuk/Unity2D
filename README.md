- **Features**:
  - Advanced control over background and foreground layers.
  - Main background static option for better scene control.
  - Customizable parallax multipliers, depth steps, and vertical shifts.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your Unity project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Unity2D-Scripts.git
   ```
2. Copy the desired scripts into your projectâ€™s `Assets/Scripts` directory.
3. Assign and configure the scripts in your Unity scenes as needed.

## Usage

### BackgroundMusicController
Attach `BackgroundMusicController.cs` to a GameObject that holds an `AudioSource`. Set the `AudioSource` in the Inspector, and use the `PlayMusic()`, `StopMusic()`, and `FadeOutMusic()` methods to control the background music.

### EnvironmentAudioMixer
Attach `EnvironmentAudioMixer.cs` to a GameObject and set two `AudioSource` components in the Inspector. Use `PlayAndCrossfade()` to switch and blend between audio clips smoothly.

### EnvironmentalSoundController
Attach `EnvironmentalSoundController.cs` to a GameObject. Configure `AudioSource` components for atmosphere, wind, and animal sounds, and define clip settings through the Inspector to manage playback intervals and volume.

### PlayerAudioController
Attach `PlayerAudioController.cs` to the player GameObject and link it to `PlayerController2D`. Assign audio clips and `AudioSource` components for each action, and set up audio mixer groups as needed.

### FlexibleParallax & GlobalParallax
Add `FlexibleParallax.cs` or `GlobalParallax.cs` to a camera GameObject. Group your background and foreground layers, set parallax multipliers, and adjust the `depthStep` for Z-axis distribution.
